        Contact management is a means of entering customer and lead data for
        storage, quick access, editing and tracking. Contact management can be
        as simple as a spreadsheet or as complex as customer relationship
        management (CRM) software.
        <br />
        <br />
        By digitizing contact management, you can give your employees access to
        valuable customer data. All departments can view the same data, so you
        speed up communication and streamline processes. When you make
        communication more efficient, you can focus less on business tasks and
        more on your customers.

        In today’s business environment, you have to do more than just
        personalize a sales email with someone’s name in order to make a sale.
        Customers are loyal to companies that remember their specific
        preferences, and they expect a stellar experience every time they place
        an order online or receive a package in the mail. Going above and beyond
        not only creates repeat sales but also encourages referrals, which could
        significantly decrease your overall customer acquisition costs.
